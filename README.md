# My168Plan

The goal of this app is to help users visualize how they want to spend the hours of their week.

Most of us are used to using a calendar or weekly planner to organize our meetings, appointments, reminders, activities, etc. But we often don't stop to zoom out and reflect on what we value, and if we are allocating our time according to our values.  It is easy to deny that how we actually spend our time is often out of sync with our values.


## Technology

This is my pet project to learn current front-end tech (since I'm a couple years out of date!)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It's currently using react 18.2.0.

It's also using [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) for UI components.

I'm sure I will add other frameworks or libraries as well, and I will very likely forget to update this README when I do. *Consider yourself warned.*

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

*Don't bother - you know there aren't any tests! HAHAHA!*

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
